MST - Pucgh AI Hackathon Project
Team Name: MST
üí° Project Introduction
Welcome to the official repository for the MST team's project for the Pucgh AI Hackathon! This project is a demonstration of our team's skills in leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to build a solution to a real-world problem.

Our project focuses on [briefly state what your project does]. It aims to [explain the main goal of your project, e.g., simplify a complex process, provide instant information, assist users with a specific task].

This repository serves as a practice ground and a final showcase of our work, encapsulating our journey from ideation to implementation.

‚ú® Features
This section highlights the key functionalities of our project.

[Feature 1]: A concise description of a core feature (e.g., "AI-Powered Chatbot: Provides instant and accurate responses to user queries.")

[Feature 2]: Another key feature (e.g., "Sentiment Analysis: Analyzes user input to understand emotion and tailor responses accordingly.")

[Feature 3]: A third feature (e.g., "Knowledge Retrieval: Pulls information from a custom knowledge base for grounded answers.")
